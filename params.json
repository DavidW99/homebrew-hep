{"name":"Homebrew-hep","tagline":"High energy physics packages for Mac","body":"## Introduction\r\nMany high energy physics programs require special installation instructions for Mac OS X, and their issue trackers are often filled with unresolved Mac issues. Problems are also encountered when trying to link all these programs together.\r\n\r\nHomebrew-hep is a Mac package manager for HEP programs, based on [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). In Homebrew language, it is a tap. From the end-user's perspective it is nice because it:\r\n* keeps things organised in `/usr/local` \r\n* automatically handles package dependencies\r\n* is easy to update programs\r\n\r\n## Instructions\r\n1. Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/): `ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)\"`\r\n2. Tap homebrew-hep: `brew tap davidchall/hep`\r\n3. Install HEP packages: `brew install <package>` (e.g. `brew install pythia8`)\r\n\r\nA list of available HEP packages can be found [here](https://github.com/davidchall/homebrew-hep).\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n* __Homebrew:__ `brew help`, `man brew`, or the Homebrew [wiki](http://wiki.github.com/mxcl/homebrew)\r\n* __HEP package:__ `brew info <package>`\r\n\r\n### Help\r\nIf you are experiencing problems with a specific package, please report it on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/davidchall/homebrew-hep/issues). Please note that this is intended for issues arising from Mac installation, not problems with the package itself.\r\n\r\n### Can I contribute?\r\nOf course! Some possible ways could be:\r\n* add a new package\r\n* add a new option to an existing package\r\n* update a package to the latest version\r\n\r\nPlease see the Homebrew-hep [wiki](https://github.com/davidchall/homebrew-hep/wiki) for full instructions on how you can help.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
